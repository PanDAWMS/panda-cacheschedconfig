cachescedconfig
---------------

cacheschedconfig dumps schedconfig into a single directory organised
by queue, in order to make queue data downloads both fast and robust.

The RPM also includes code to build the pilot tarball caches from SVN.


Building
--------

To build this package from source do

python setup.py bdist --formats=rpm

*** N.B. Because of a problem in the way Redhat flavour RPMs are built
you must have this rpm macro defined:

%_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0

which prevents rpmbuild from failing because of the .pyo files which
get built automatically.

The easist way to do this is to add that line to ~/.rpmmacros.
